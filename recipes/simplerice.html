  <h4>Description</h4>

  </p>
  <h3>Ingredients</h3>
  <ul>
    <li>1 tablespoon olive oil
    </li>
    <li>1 cup long-grain white rice
    </li>
    <li>1 pinch garlic salt, or to taste</li>
    <li>Â½ small onion, finely diced
    </li>
    <li>2 cups low-sodium chicken broth
    </li>
  </ul>
  <h2>Steps</h2>
  <ol>
    <li>Heat olive oil in a non-stick saucepan over medium-high heat nearly to smoking. Cook and stir rice in the hot
      oil
      quickly to toast the rice, 2 to 3 minutes. Stir the onion into the rice; cook and stir 1 minute more. Pour chicken
      broth
      over the rice mixture, season with garlic salt, and bring to a boil; reduce heat to low, place a cover on the
      saucepan,
      and cook until the broth is absorbed and the rice is tender, about 20 minutes. Remove from heat and allow to rest
      5
      minutes before lifting the lid.</li>
  </ol>
